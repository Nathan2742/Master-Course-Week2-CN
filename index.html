        <p id="para1">
            The reason i joined CodeNations Master course was to progress further with my knowledge and skills with coding. Hopfully from this i will be able to become employable and in turn be able to start my career within coding. Another reason why i was excited and wanted to join another course with codenation is that i find the courses extremely fun and enjoyable but i am also able to gain alot of knowledge along side this.

            A goal of mine is to be able to code and understand javascript. The progress i have made for this is in week 1 we learned about the fundimentals and basics needed when it comes to coding and understanding javascript.

        </span>
    <span>
        <p class="para">
            Another goal of mine is to be able to confidently research solutions when i come across problems. I feel i have made good progress when it comes to this as after doing the activities i have needed to research my own solutions and instead of the instructors giving you the answer they instead point you in the right direction to be able to do your own research.
        </p>
    </span>

        <p class="para">
            One final goal of mine is to start a career in coding. I feel like i am making great progress towards this as i am on my third course with codenation. This means i keep gaining more and more knowledge to be able to be what an employer is looking for. In doing these courses with codenation i also gain a qualifaction and work experience which is great to become more employable.
